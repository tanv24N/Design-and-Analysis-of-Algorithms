# 0/1 Knapsack Problem - Multiple Solution Approaches

## Overview
This project provides multiple C implementations to solve the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** using:

- ‚úÖ Random Instance Generator  
- üß† Brute Force Algorithm  
- üì¶ Refined Dynamic Programming  
- ‚ö° Improved Greedy Approximation (Greedy 4)

Each program reads from a standardized input file and produces a corresponding output file, detailing selected items and results.
